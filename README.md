# Canvas Experiments

A playground for exploring the power of HTML5 Canvas - from visualizations to games to creative coding.

**[Live Demo](https://ldraney.github.io/canvas-experiments/)**

## Projects

### [Visual Effects Gallery](./visual-effects-gallery/)
36 interactive demos showcasing HTML5 Canvas capabilities, organized by category and difficulty:
- **Particles** - Floating dust, mouse attraction, fireworks, galaxy spirals
- **Fractals** - Recursive trees, Mandelbrot set, Julia set, L-systems
- **Generative** - Flow fields, circle packing, Voronoi, organic growth
- **Gradients** - Plasma effect, aurora borealis, liquid gradients, fire
- **Animation** - Easing functions, spring physics, morphing shapes, 3D starfield
- **Physics** - Bouncing balls, pendulums, cloth simulation, metaballs

### [Music Visualization](./music-visualization/)
Real-time audio-reactive visualization that responds to lofi music. Features:
- Web Audio API frequency analysis
- Beat detection algorithm
- Layered canvas rendering (particles, waveforms, geometric shapes)
- Lofi aesthetic effects (film grain, vignette, scanlines)

## Getting Started

Each project is self-contained. Navigate to a project folder and start a local server:

```bash
cd music-visualization
npx serve
```

## Tech Stack
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 Canvas API
- Web Audio API
- No frameworks or build tools required

## License
MIT - Feel free to use these experiments as learning resources or starting points for your own projects.
